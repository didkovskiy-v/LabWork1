## Description  
This project implements a BMP image processor that loads 24-bit uncompressed BMP files and provides the following operations:
- Loading and saving BMP images
- Rotating the image 90 degrees clockwise
- Rotating the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise
- Applying a Gaussian blur filter
The implementation uses a pure abstract base class and a concrete raster image class, with full unit tests.
